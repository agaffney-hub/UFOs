# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this assignment is to create a sighting index of UFO sightings in a visual form of a data table, as well as being able to filter through the data using five separate filters, while being confined to an html page that you can scroll and search.

## Results:

The page was successful in loading, as well as being able to fit with a dark theme that emulates like space, while creating a visual effect that is pleasing with the photo banner on top.

This is the filter input box on the side that allows for many different parameters to be looked for within the data given.

One drawback of this page is that you can only search by a certain day criteria; you can not look for whole years within the data. Even if it does turn a lot of results, this also means you can not filter results for only one month either. A user who is looking for data within a timespan would have to search through all the data individiually to be able to find this result.

One development reccomendation I had was to be able to add a search tick box filter for duration of event. Some were very small and only a minute, but being able to see the large events that are thirty minutes or even longer would be nice to filter for!
Another reccomendation is a little harder to enact since the data set is so large and would require a lot of fine tuning, but with how some results do not fit the criteria, like how one result says that the duration of the event was "downtown". Adding a numerical requirement or an alias requirement (for state names being written out rather than the shortened versions) would help with certain fields.
